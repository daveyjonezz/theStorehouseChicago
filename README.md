## Overview
Welcome to the Storehouse Chicago! We are a non-profit in the heart of Chicago that lends a helping-hand to struggling families. Chicago is a *very large* city that holds over 2.5 million residents, and where almost 5,500 residents where considered homeless in 2018. Fortunetly, the number of homeless residents has been steadily decreasing for the past three years. Unfortunetly, there are people and families who come into difficult times and face living on the streets. That's where we come in. 

> Our mission as The StoreHouse Chicago is to come alongside and aid the people in our city to achieve their goals,
> empower them as individuals, and equip them for their future

Through monitary donations, we can send support to families who need a little extra help to get back on their feet. We pair with local churches to spotlight a family or individual in order to build a lasting relationship through the community. On our website users are able to read about three of the families we are helping, write messages of support to send directly to the families, purchase stylish street wear, and even donate money.

If you would like more information about the Storehouse Chicago in regards to lending a hand or to nominate a family, please contact us at info@thestorehousechicago.com
